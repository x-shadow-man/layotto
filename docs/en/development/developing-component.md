# Component Development Guide

Thank you for your support for Layotto!

This is a Layotto components development guide. Layotto components are written in Go. If you are unfamiliar with Go, checkout here [Go tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

When developing new components, you can refer to the existing components. For example, if you want to implement distributed lock API with ZooKeeper, you can refer to the realization of the redis, related demos, and design documents to make your development easier.
## 1、Preparation Work

1. Git clone the repository to your preferred directory
2. Use Docker to launch the environment you need. For example, if you want to develop a distributed lock API with ZooKeeper, you need to start a ZooKeeper container locally with Docker for local tests.
   If you do not have Docker locally, you can install a Docker Desktop by following [Docker Desktop tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/docker/windows-docker-install.html). Mac and Windows are both supported, easy to use.
   
## 2、Development Components and Unit Tests
### 2.1.Create a new folder under Components/API directory to develop your components

The folder name is the component name, referring to the redis component below

![img.png](../../img/development/component/img.png)

Potential tools you may use in the process of development (for the purpose of reference only, hope to simplify the development) :

- Once staring a new goroutine, panic triggered in it may lead to a panic breakdown to the entire server. Therefore, it is common to start a goroutine with recover() inside deferred functions. You can also use the encapsulated utility classes, like utils.GoWithRecover in mosn.io/pkg/utils/goroutine.go

- log.DefaultLogger is a commonly used logging tool, and it is located in mosn.io/pkg/log/errorlog.go

- Others: There are utility classes under pkg/common and mosn.io/pkg directory

### 2.2. Copy and Paste Other Components

You can simply copy and paste other components for modification or development. For example, if you want to implement the distributed lock API using ZooKeeper, you can copy and paste the Redis component

### 2.3. Write Unit Tests!
#### 2.3.1. Unit testing considerations
Unit tests will be run in various environments, including the docker provided by github action and other developers' computers. Thus, following problems need to be considered to run unit tests normally:
- Other people may not have ZooKeeper installed in their environments. So when we write a unit test, either mock out the network call code (for example, mock out the part of the ZooKeeper code in unit tests) or create a simple version of ZooKeeper in the unit test (for example, in the Redis Unit test, A mini-redis will be created) to ensure others can pass the test.
- Since every time someone commits code, it automatically runs unit tests, and they are merged only when they are all passed. Therefore, try to avoid sleeping too long in the unit test (sleeping too long can decrease the speed for unit tests)
#### 2.3.2. How to mock out dependencies in the environment once running unit tests? (Such as Mock ZooKeeper or Mock Redis)

It is usually to encapsulate all network call code into a single interface, and then mock out that interface in ut. Taking the unit tests in Apollo configuration center as an example, and refer to components/configstores/apollo/configstore.go. and
components/configstores/ apollo/configstore_test.go:

First, in configstore.go, encapsulating all calls to the SDK and network calls to Apollo into a single interface.


![mock.png](../../img/development/component/mock.png)
![img_8.png](../../img/development/component/img_8.png)

Then, encapsulating your code that calls the SDK and network into a struct which achieves that interface:

![img_9.png](../../img/development/component/img_9.png)

Once you've done this refactoring, your code is testable (this is part of the idea of test-driven development, refactoring code into a form that can be injectable in order to improve its testability)

Next, we can mock that interface when we write ut:


![img_10.png](../../img/development/component/img_10.png)

Just mock it into the struct you want to test, and test it.

![img_11.png](../../img/development/component/img_11.png)

Note: Generally, during "integration test", network call will be made and a normal ZooKeeper or Redis will be called. On contract, the single test focuses on the local logic, and will not call the real environment


## 3、Register Components When Layotto Starts
Following the steps above only develops components. Layotto does not automatically load them when starts.

So how to let Layotto to load the components when it start?

Need to integrate new components in cmd/layotto/main.go, including:

### 3.1. Import your components in main.go
![img_1.png](../../img/development/component/img_1.png)

### 3.2. Register your components in the NewRuntimeGrpcServer function of main.go
![img_4.png](../../img/development/component/img_4.png)

After that, Layotto initializes the ZooKeeper component if the user has configured "I want to use ZooKeeper" in the Layotto configuration file

## 4、Add Demo for Integration Test
We have already finished development, and we need an integrating test demo to run and test the entire process.

### 4.1. Add a sample configuration file


As mentioned above:
>Layotto initializes the ZooKeeper component if the user has configured "I want to use ZooKeeper" in the Layotto configuration file

So how does the user configure "I want to use ZooKeeper"? We need to provide a sample configuration, for both user reference and running integration tests

We can copy a JSON configuration file from another component, such as configs/config_lock_redis.json to configs/config_lock_zookeeper.json when developing distributed lock components.  
Then modify the configuration file shown below:

![img_3.png](../../img/development/component/img_3.png)



### 4.2. Add client Demo
We need a client demo, such as the distributed lock client demo that has two coroutines calling Layotto concurrently and only one can grab the lock

#### a. If the component has a general client, it doesn't need to be developed
If there is a common folder under demo directory, then it is a general demo that can be used by different components. You can pass the storeName parameter though the command line, and you don't need to develop the demo

![img_6.png](../../img/development/component/img_6.png)

#### b. If the component does not have a general client or requires custom metadata arguments, copy, paste, and then revise it
For example, when implementing distributed locks using ZooKeeper, you need some custom configurations. Then you can write your demo based on the Redis demo

![img_7.png](../../img/development/component/img_7.png)

Note: If there are errors in the demo code, you can trigger a panic. Later, we will use demo to run the integration test. If panic occurs, it means that the integration test fails.  
For example the demo/lock/redis/client.go:
```go
    //....
	cli, err := client.NewClient()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
    //....
```

### 4.3. Refer to the QuickStart documentation to start Layotto and Demo and see if any errors are reported
For example, refer to the [QuickStart documentation of the Distributed Lock API](zh/start/lock/start.md) , start your dependent environment (such as ZooKeeper), and start Layotto (remember to use the configuration file you just added!). Then check for errors.

Note: The error below is fine, just ignore it


![img_2.png](../../img/development/component/img_2.png)

Start demo and call Layotto to see if any errors are reported. For a general client, pass the argument storename via -s flag in command line 

![img_5.png](../../img/development/component/img_5.png)

No error indicates that the test passed!

## 5、Description Documents for Added Components
After finishing the coding part, it is suggested to include a configuration documentation for the component, to explain what configuration items are supported and how to start the dependent environment (for example, how to start ZooKeeper with Docker).

You can refer to the [Redis component description of the Lock API (Chinese)](zh/component_specs/lock/redis.md) and [the Redis component description of the Lock API (English)](en/component_specs/lock/redis.md), also can copy, paste, and revise.
